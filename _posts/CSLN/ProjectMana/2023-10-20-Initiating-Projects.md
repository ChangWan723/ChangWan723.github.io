_Initiating Process Summary_

## Pre-initiation Tasks

- It is good practice to lay the groundwork for a project **before it officially starts**
- Senior managers often perform several pre-initiation tasks
  - **Determine** the **scope**, **time**, and **cost** constraints for the project
  - **Identify** the project **sponsor**
  - **Select** the project **manager**
  - **Develop** a _business case_ for a project
  - **Meet** with the project manager to **review** the **process** and **expectations** for managing the project
  - **Determine** if the project should be **divided** into two or more **smaller projects**

### Business Case for a Project

- A **business case** is a document that provides **identifies the reason** for initiating a project, including its *
  *value**, **benefit**, and the **business problem** it’s designed to solve.
- The **completed business case** provides **structure** for the project and project **organization** throughout the
  project lifecycle.
  - Therefore, it should be used routinely for reference and not consigned to the shelf.
- The project **sponsor** and project **board** should review and update the business case at **key stages** to check
  that the **project remains viable**, and the **reasons** for doing it are still **valid**.
  - Ideally, the review should take place before starting a new stage to **avoid unnecessary investment** in time and
    money.

**Typical contents of Business Case:**

- Introduction/Background
- Business Objective
- Current Situation and Problem/Opportunity Statement
- Critical Assumptions and Constraints
- Analysis of Options and Recommendations
- Preliminary Project Requirements
- Budget Estimate and Financial Analysis
- Schedule Estimate
- Potential Risks
- Exhibits

## Initiating Projects

- Initiating includes **recognising** and **starting** a new project
  - the right kinds of projects for the **right reasons**
- Strategic planning should serve as the foundation for deciding which projects to pursue
  - Expresses the **vision**, **mission**, **goals**, **objectives**, and **strategies** of the organisation
  - Provides the basis for IT project planning
- Develop project charter
  - Project charter
  - Assumption log
- Identifying project stakeholders
  - Stakeholder register
- Holding a kick-off meeting

### Project integration management

#### Project Charter

##### Creating a Project Charter

- A **project charter** is a document that formally recognises the existence of a project and provides a **summary** of
  the project’s **objectives** and **management**
- It **authorises** the project manager to use organisational **resources** to complete the project
- Ideally, the **project manager** will play a **major role** in developing the project charter
- **Instead** of project charters, some organisations initiate projects using a simple **letter of agreement or formal
  contracts**
- A **crucial** part of the project charter is the **sign-off** section

##### Contents of a Project Charter

- The project’s **title** and **date of authorisation**
- A **summary schedule** or **timeline**, including the **planned start** and **finish dates**; if a summary milestone
  schedule is available, it should also be included or referenced
- A summary of the project’s **estimated cost** and **budget** allocation
- The project **manager’s name** and contact information
- A brief description of the **project objectives**, including the **business need** or the other justification for
  authorising the project
- Project **success criteria** or approval requirements, including project **approval requirements** and who **signs off
  ** on the project
- A summary of the **planned approach** for managing the project, which should describe **stakeholder needs** and *
  *expectations**, overall **project risk**, important **assumptions** and **constraints**, and should refer to *
  *related documents**, such as a communications **management plan**, as available
- A **roles** and **responsibilities** matrix
- A **sign-off** section for signatures of **key project stakeholders**
- A **comments section** in which stakeholders can provide important comments related to the project

##### Project Charter vs. Business Case

- A project charter and business case have the **same fundamentals**: these are both **tools** to **pitch a project** to
  the appropriate **stakeholders**.
- The **main difference** between a project charter and a business case is **scope**and **area** of focus.
  - Project charter outlines a **high-level project description and deliverables**, while a business case describes what
    a company is **trying to get** from a project in terms of **return on investment**, **future opportunity** and so
    on.
  - Project charter **names** and **authorises** the **project managers** of a project while a business case **justifies
    ** a **company's decision** on why it should **take up a project**.

#### Assumptions Log

- An **assumption log** is a document used to record and track **assumptions** and **constraints** throughout the
  project life cycle.
- It aids in **communicating** information to **key stakeholders** and avoids **potential confusion**.
- Most projects include **several assumptions** that affect the scope, time, cost, risk, and other **knowledge areas**.
- It is important to **document** and **validate** these assumptions.

### Project stakeholder management

#### Identifying Stakeholders

- **Project stakeholders** are the people **involved in** or affected by project activities
  - **Internal project stakeholders** generally include the **project sponsor, project team, support staff, and internal customers** for the project. Other internal stakeholders include **top management**, other **functional managers**, and **other project managers**
  - **External project stakeholders** include the **project’s customers** (if they are external to the organization), **competitors**, **suppliers**, and **other external groups** that are potentially **involved** in or **affected** by the project, such as **government officials** and **concerned citizens**

#### Stakeholder Register and Stakeholder Analysis

- A **stakeholder register** is a document that includes details related to the identified project stakeholders, usually available to many people, so it should **not include sensitive information**
- A **stakeholder analysis** is a technique for analysing information to determine which stakeholders’ interests to focus on and how to increase stakeholder support throughout the project

#### Categorising Engagement Levels of Stakeholders

- **Unaware**: Unaware of the project and its potential impacts on them
- **Resistant**: Aware of the project yet resistant to change
- **Neutral**: Aware of the project yet neither supportive nor resistant
- **Supportive**: Aware of the project and supportive of change
- **Leading**: Aware of the project and its potential impacts and actively engaged in helping it succeed

### Holding a Project Kick-off Meeting

- Experienced project managers know that it is crucial to get projects off to a great start.
- A **kick-off meeting** is a meeting held at the beginning of a project so that **stakeholders** can meet each other, *
  *review the goals** of the project, and **discuss future plans**.
  - Note that the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition, suggests that the kick-off meeting be held during the end of the
    planning or start of the executing process group. In the author’s experience, it is best hold it earlier.
- The **project champion** should speak first and introduce the **project sponsor** and **project manager**
- Good preparation is essential for the meeting to be a success.

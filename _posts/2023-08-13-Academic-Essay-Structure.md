## Clear Thesis (Purpose)

* A thesis is a line of argument and identified purpose
* It can be an argument that needs support and discussion, an enquiry that requires exploration, a suggestion that requires evaluation, etc.
* A thesis should be clearly stated in the introduction.
* All paragraphs (topics/points) should be linked clearly to the thesis (purpose) of the essay
  * This is normally done in the first and/or last sentence of the paragraph


## Introduction


*  Introduces why this topic is interesting
   * Justify why this should be written and read
*  Summarises key points that will be discussed later
   * Show the reader what issues will be covered and how your essay is organised
*  Offers a thesis statement
   * State the purpose of the essay and the point(s) it is making

* Is **written in the introduction**, usually as the last sentence(s)
* Shows very clearly what the focus of the essay is and what it is doing
* States the nature and purpose of the essay (e.g. to argue, analyse, suggest, identify, evaluate, etc.)
* Communicates the position of the author to the subject.
  * Unlike many novels or stories, surprises or twists should not appear in essays
  * The opinion and ideas of the author must be clear in the thesis statement and in the essay as a whole

## Body

* Divides part of the discussion into topics
* Keeps topics in paragraphs of similar sizes
* Offers evidence, details and deep discussion that are not in the introduction and conclusion
* Maintains focus on answering the essay question throughout
* Divides purposes of topics â€“ e.g. cause & effect, problem & solution, analysis & interpretation

## What is a Bitmap?

A bitmap is **an array of bits** that efficiently represents data in binary form. Each bit corresponds to a particular value or condition, and **the state of the bit (`0` or `1`) indicates the absence or presence of that value**.

**Bitmaps can use a very small space to quickly determine if an element is in a certain set.**

### Advantages of Bitmaps

- **Memory Efficiency**: Bitmaps are highly space-efficient, especially when representing large sets of binary data.
- **Fast Operations**: Bit-level operations are extremely fast, making bitmaps ideal for high-performance applications.
- **Simple Implementation**: The structure and manipulation of bitmaps are straightforward, allowing for easy implementation and use.

### Applications of Bitmaps

Bitmaps are used in various applications, including:

1. **Image Representation**: In graphics, bitmaps represent images, where each pixel's color is stored as a series of bits.
2. **Data Compression**: Bitmaps are used in data compression techniques to represent repetitive data efficiently.
3. **Membership Testing**: In databases and information retrieval, bitmaps quickly check the existence of elements within a set.
4. **Network Routing**: Bitmaps help manage routing tables and efficiently handle network paths.
5. **Bloom Filters**: Bitmaps are a core component of bloom filters, used for probabilistic membership testing.

## How Bitmaps Work

### Basic Operations

1. **Setting a Bit**: To set a bit at a specific position, use the bitwise `OR` operation.
2. **Clearing a Bit**: To clear a bit, use the bitwise `AND` operation with a mask.
3. **Checking a Bit**: To check the state of a bit, use the bitwise `AND` operation.

### Example in Java

Here’s a simple example of how to use a bitmap in Java:

```java
public class Bitmap {
    private byte[] bitmap; // we can also use int[], long[], char[], etc.

    public Bitmap(int size) {
        bitmap = new byte[(size + 7) / 8]; // the byte holds 8 bits
    }

    public void setBit(int position) {
        int index = position / 8;
        int offset = position % 8;
        bitmap[index] |= (1 << offset);
    }

    public void clearBit(int position) {
        int index = position / 8;
        int offset = position % 8;
        bitmap[index] &= ~(1 << offset);
    }

    public boolean checkBit(int position) {
        int index = position / 8;
        int offset = position % 8;
        return (bitmap[index] & (1 << offset)) != 0;
    }
}
```


## Bloom Filter: Applications of Bitmap

A Bloom filter is a binary array of `m` bits, all initially set to 0, accompanied by `k` hash functions. Each hash function maps elements to a bit in the array.

**Bloom filters allow for false positives** (indicating an element is in the set when it is not) **but no false negatives** (an element not being in the set when it is). **In other words, Bloom filters can be used to query whether an element is "probably in the set" or "definitely not in the set".**

### Why do We Need Bloom Filters?

- **Because if the range of the element to be checked is too large, it will lead to low space utilisation of the bitmap.**
    - For example, if we want to check if a number in the range of 1 billion is in the bitmap, then we need 1 billion bits of memory. If the number to be checked is only 100, then there is a lot of wasted space

---

A simple solution to the above problem: **hash the number to force it to a smaller fixed range.** But in this way, **the probability of hash conflict is too high** (i.e. the probability of false positive is too high).

- That's why we need Bloom filters.
  - Since there is a high probability of hash conflict with a single hash function, **the probability of hash conflict (false positive) can be greatly reduced by using multiple hash functions**.

_false negatives: we only added 146 and 196, but 177 will check as positive_

### How Bloom Filters Work

1. **Insertion**: To add an element, compute `k` hash values for the element, each determining a position in the bit array. Set the bits at these positions to 1.
2. **Query**: To check if an element is in the set, compute its `k` hash values. If all corresponding bits are `1`, the element is probably in the set. If any bit is `0`, the element is definitely not in the set.

### Example in Java

Here’s a simple example of implementing a Bloom filter in Java:

```java
public class BloomFilter {
    private BitSet bitSet;
    private int bitArraySize;
    private int numberOfHashFunctions;

    public BloomFilter(int size, int hashFunctions) {
        bitSet = new BitSet(size);
        bitArraySize = size;
        numberOfHashFunctions = hashFunctions;
    }

    private int[] hash(Object item) {
        int[] hashes = new int[numberOfHashFunctions];
        Random random = new Random(item.hashCode());
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfHashFunctions; i++) {
            hashes[i] = random.nextInt(bitArraySize);
        }
        return hashes;
    }

    public void add(Object item) {
        int[] hashes = hash(item);
        for (int hash : hashes) {
            bitSet.set(hash);
        }
    }

    public boolean contains(Object item) {
        int[] hashes = hash(item);
        for (int hash : hashes) {
            if (!bitSet.get(hash)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Limitations of Bloom Filters

- **False Positives**: May incorrectly indicate that an element is in the set.
- **Non-Removable Elements**: Once an element is added, it cannot be removed without potential errors.

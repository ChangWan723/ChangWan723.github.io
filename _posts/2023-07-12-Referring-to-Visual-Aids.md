## Referring to data in visual aids

### Referring to slide content

The first important step when give a presentation and referring to visuals is to clearly locate what you're talking about for your audience. So you may say some phrases like:
- You can see in the image...
- If you look at this slide...
- Here are the data from our questionnaire.
- Locating a point on a slide:
- On the left side… On the right her...
- At the top… At the bottom...
- In the first row, you can see... 

### Describing results and trends

It is important to locate and to describe effectively the key data. It is also crucial to reference where the information came from.

Highlight the information which is important, it can help your audience locate them. For example:
<center>
    <img class="image-style" src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/07/13/pChAomn.png">
    <br>
</center>

Here's an example of describing the data in the table:

>So now let’s look at some findings on how international students spend their leisure time. As you can see, the first column on the left shows the students’ country of origin, and then the six columns on the right provide details of their different leisure activities. The points in bold represent the most popular activities for each group. As the data shows playing computer games was the most popular activity among Chinese students. For the Japanese students shopping was rated the most popular activity. So, what is the significance of this, if any? …

## Referencing visuals

### Referencing in presentations vs. essays

- On-slide citation (Author, Date and perhaps title or page number)
- ‘References’ slide at the end includes specific location
- Fewer references – be selective 
- More visuals required
- More or fewer figures and tables 
- It may contain images and photographs from websites

### Photos from internet

**Citation order:**
- Photographer
- Year of publication (in round brackets)
- Title of photograph (in italics)
- Available at: URL  Accessed: date              

#### author

Check for creator of image e.g. photographer or organisation

- If no author, use may use organisation 
- If no organisation, use may use short url 
- Finding the creator takes extra research skills 
- It may be a website has not credited an author/creator

#### date

- Look for a date for the image
- If none, you may give the date the website was last updated/published (often at the bottom of the site) NB: Be careful here as they may not be original creator.
- If no date can been seen, then write ‘no date’

### Own images

**No references on your slides mean the image or photograph was created or taken by you.**

But, you also need:

- Permission from people in the photo
- If you adapt a visual or image write ‘adapted from’

### Example

#### Example of photographs

<center>
    <img class="image-style" 
    src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/07/13/pChALfU.png">
    <br>
    <div style="color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;
    display: inline-block;
    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">Gave a caption ‘Guo Pei’. Then, in brackets, wrote the photographer surname ‘Shaer’. The year the image was created was 2015 or 2016. If you are not sure about the date, you can write 'no date'.</div>
</center>



#### Example of Diagram reference

<center>
    <img class="image-style" 
    src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/07/13/pChA7T0.png">
    <br>
    <div style="color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;
    display: inline-block;
    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">You can use ‘Figure’ captions or use the titles on the slides, but it is not necessary.</div>

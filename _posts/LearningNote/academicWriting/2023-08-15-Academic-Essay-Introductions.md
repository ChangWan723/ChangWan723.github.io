## Characteristics of Strong and Week Introductions

### Strong introductions

* introduce the topic clearly
* arouse interest
* give several sentences of info about the topic
* state the thesis of the essay

### Week introductions

* do not give enough info about the topic
* give too much info about the topic
* talk about too many different topics
* do not state the thesis

## Introduction Contents

There are different kinds of information which you may find in introductions. Some of them are introduced in the next. However, it does **not** mean that your introductions will **need all of them**.

### Contents

* a definition of any difficult words
* a review of some literature
* background to your research (relevance)
* your purpose of the paper
* your research method and results
* the limitations of the paper
* an outline of the structure

### Some examples of different contents

#### Definition of any difficult words

>Privatisation is the process of transferring certain industries from state control to the private sector, which began in Britain in 1981 with British Telecom.

#### Review of some literature

>A number of researchers have examined this issue, notably Smith & Wesson (2011)â€¦

>Various investigations have explored the subject, especially. .


#### Background

>In recent years the privatisation of state owned businesses, especially monopoly utilities such as electricity and telecoms, has become widespread in both developed and developing nations.

#### Relevance

>As privatisation is increasingly seen as a remedy for economic ills in many other countries, it is worth examining its impact in Britain, which was a pioneer in this process.

#### Limitation

>Only privatisations completed between 1981-95 will be dealt with, as it is too soon to assess the impact of later developments.

#### Outline

>An assessment will first be made of the performance of the privatised industries themselves, on an individual basis, and then the performance of the economy as a whole will be examined.

## Funnel Structure of Introduction

You should **start with a general statement about a topic**, outlining some key issues but explain that your **essay will focus on a specific one**.

## Checklist

When you have finished writing your introduction, you can check it according to the following checklist:

* Is it likely to interest the reader? Why?
* Does it start with a general statement related to the topic and gradually become more specific?
* Is there a thesis statement that tells the reader what the essay will be about? Does it state the writer's position? Can you easily identify it?
* Does the introduction give an overview of the essay structure?
* Are ideas clearly linked between sentences or is it sometimes confusing?

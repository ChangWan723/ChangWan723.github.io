## What is Academic Integrity?

* Plagiarism
   
   Reproducing or paraphrasing work **without** acknowledging (referencing) the author.

* Falsification
   
   Falsification is any attempt to present imaginary (made up) or distorted data or other material and knowingly to use such material.

* Cheating

  Cheating is any action before, during or after an examination in which a candidate tries to gain an unfair advantage or helps others to do so.

## Examples of Plagiarism 

* Including in one's own work extracts from another person's work without the use of quotation marks and without referencing the source.
* The use of the ideas of another person without referencing the source.
* Paraphrasing or summarising another person's work **without referencing the source**.
* Submitting a piece of work entirely as their own when it was produced with the help of others.
* Submitting imagery (graphs, charts, diagrams, drawings, other visuals) without indicating the source of the work (references). 


## How to avoid Plagiarism 

* Paraphrase by rewriting the sections you intend to use from your sources **in your own words** and **referencing the source**.
* Reference correctly (authors family name, date, page number (if a quote) ).
* Format your reference list accurately and use consistent style.
* Reference all ideas **as well as** direct text.
* Always plan before you start writing.
* Read then write!  Do not read and write!
* Make careful notes detailing where you got your ideas (in case you forget).

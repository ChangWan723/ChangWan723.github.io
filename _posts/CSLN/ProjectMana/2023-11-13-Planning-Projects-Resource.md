## Project Resource Management

- Every project needs resources. These can be **human resources**, **machines** and **materials**.
  - Human resources are probably the only resources used in services. Hence, a project needs to plan human resources that would be required.
  - This would include the numbers of resources, their locations, and their skills.
  - Project resource management is concerned with making **effective use** of the **people** involved with a project and **physical resources** (materials, facilities, equipment, and infrastructure)

## Project organisational chart

Similar to a company’s organisational chart, a **project organisational chart** is a graphical representation of how **authority** and **responsibility** are distributed within the project
- This can be depicted in two ways: using **reporting relationship** and using **skills**
  - When we create a structure showing **reporting relationships**, it is called **Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS)**
  - When the structure is made on the basis of **skills of the team** it is called **Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)**

### An Example of Organizational Breakdown Structure

## Responsibility Assignment Matrices

A **responsibility assignment matrix** (RAM) is a matrix that maps the work of the project as described in the **work breakdown structure** (WBS) to the people responsible for performing the work
- For **smaller** projects, it is best to assign **WBS activities to individuals**;
- For **larger** projects, it is more effective to assign the work to **organisational units** or **teams**

### RACI charts

RACI charts are a type of **RAM** that show:
- **Responsible** (who does the task)
- **Accountable** (who signs off on the task or has authority for it)
- **Consulted** (who has information necessary to complete the task)
- **Informed** (who needs to be notified of task status/results)

## Resource Histograms

- Once we have assigned the work, we will be able to come up with staffing requirements in the form of a **Resource Histogram**.
- **Resource Histogram** is a bar chart showing staff requirements over the period of the project as shown
  below:

## Staffing Management Plans

A **staffing management plan** describes when and how people will be **added** to and **removed** from a project.
- The plan should also include ways of **hiring** and **releasing** resources.
  - Project resources can either be **hired** from **within the company** or from **outside by recruiting** new resources.
- It describes the **types of people needed** to work on the project, **the numbers needed** for each type of person each month, and **how these resources** will be acquired, trained, rewarded, and reassigned after the project

## Estimating Activity Resources

**Estimating activity resources** involves **estimating** the **type**, **quantity** and **characteristics** of **team resources** and **physical resources** (i.e., materials, equipment, and supplies) required to complete the project.
- This process is closely related to estimating **activity durations** and **costs**.
- It is important that the people who help determine what resources are necessary include people who have **experience** and **expertise** in similar projects and with the **organization performing** the **project**.
- Resource estimates should be **updated** as needed during the project.

### Important Questions to Answer in Activity Resource Estimating

- How **difficult** will it be to perform specific activities on this project?
- Is there anything **unique** in the project’s scope statement that will affect resources?
- Are there **specific resources** better **suited** to perform the activities?
- What is the **organization’s history** in doing similar activities?
- Have they done **similar activities before**? What level of personnel did the work?
- Does the organisation have **appropriate people**, **equipment**, and **materials** available for performing the work?
- Are there any organisational **policies** that might affect the availability of resources?
- Does the organisation need to **acquire** more resources to accomplish the work?
- Would it make sense to **outsource** some work?
- Will **outsourcing increase** or **decrease** the amount of resources needed and their **availability**?
- What **assumptions** have been made or need to be made?

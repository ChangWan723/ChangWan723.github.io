## CONTENT

* **INTRODUCTION** - thesis statement is present and has a clear and appropriate position 
* One **main** point in each (BODY) paragraph only 
* Each paragraph has a clear topic sentence 
* Each point is supported with sufficient **reasons/explanation**, relevant details/examples 
* The argument is present and clear **throughout** 
* **CONCLUSION** restates the main argument/ position taken (does not have examples or a new point)

## USE OF SOURCES

* Main argument is backed by POINTS made by experts using sources 
* All facts, details e.g. numerical data, are supported by **relevant and reliable sources** 
* There is a **clear distinction** between source content and writer’s voice 
* Sources are appropriate and academic 
* **In-text** citation is correct (paraphrases, quotes and summary) 
* Sources are all accurate and **consistently referenced** (in-text and end-text or references). References are in **alphabetical order**, following **consistent conventions**, such as Harvard Referencing conventions

## STRUCTURE

* Points are **logical, sequential and appropriate** to support the main argument 
* Paragraphs are all linked and carefully developed – **signposts** are clear and indicate if it is a **continuation** of argument, **counterargument** or **extension** of the original argument 
* The main argument can be easily followed from **INTRODUCTION to CONCLUSION** and clearly shows the writer’s **position**

## COMMUNICATION

* Writing is clear and easy to follow 
* Key points are effectively conveyed – an appropriate use of **cautious language**
* A **consistent and appropriate voice** is maintained throughout 
* Readers know what **the writer’s position** is (and why the writer is making that argument) throughout
* Readers can follow the argument, identify key points and understand why particular examples/ details are included

## CLARITY AND ACCURACY

* Language is precise and accurate throughout – there is effective use of **TOPIC-SPECIFIC vocabulary** 
* Language is used appropriately to highlight relationships between ideas 
* Intended meaning is **clear** through: 
   * correct use of grammar and spelling 
   * punctuation is correctly applied (including in references)

## Visual Aids

Visual Aids can include the text on your slide, and visuals such as images, Charts, Tables, Artworks, Photographs, Graphs, Diagrams...

## Importance of Visual Aids
- Focus attention on key points​
- Aid understanding ​
- Provide visual interest to balance the spoken voice.​​

### Message retention in presentations
messages are retained better when using visual slides rather than bullet points

## Effective Visual Aids
- Support the main points you are making
- Be easy to read or understand at a glance
- Our brains only pay attention to a few pieces of verbal information and visual information at a time	

### Visuals is as part of the assemblage
Visuals is only one part of the assemblage, you should consider all parts

- The audience has your speech, body movement and the visuals to process
- Consider how you craft, construct and unite all parts 

### Be selective, attentive and creative

There are many things to consider when looking at your visuals, Such as:

1. Background

   <center>
       <img style="border-radius: 0.3125em;
       box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);
       max-width: 100%;
       max-height: 50vh;" 
       src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/07/13/pChAqYT.png">
       <br>
   </center>
   
   Avoid backgrounds that are distracting or difficult to read from.
   Often it is best to be consistent with the background that you use.

2. Text amount

   Try not to use your powerpoint as a script! It shouldn't contain a lot of text.

3. Text accuracy 

   Proofread carefully to avoid spelling mistakes and incorrect grammar and punctuation.

4. Text font 

   <center>
       <img style="border-radius: 0.3125em;
       box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);
       max-width: 100%;
       max-height: 50vh;" 
       src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/07/13/pChA5Os.png">
       <br>
   </center>

5. Text colour

   Don't use messy colors!

   <center>
       <img style="border-radius: 0.3125em;
       box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);
       max-width: 100%;
       max-height: 50vh;" 
       src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/07/13/pChATwq.png">
       <br>
   </center>

6. Image relevance

   Images that have no obvious relationship to what you are saying may be distracting.

7. Diagram legibility 

   The diagram should be legible.

## Online presentations

- More verbal reference to visual aids without body language 
- Less content on slides 
- Leave space for your face on the recording - leave bottom right corner blank 
- Hide the sharing screen icon 
- Mouse pointer off slides

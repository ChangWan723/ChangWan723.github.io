## What is Quality?

- Quality is a term which is very often misunderstood in projects.
- Quite often it is equated to adhering to quality standards or providing the best possible features to a product.
- Experts define quality based on **conformance to requirements** and **fitness for use**.
  - **Conformance to requirements** means that the project’s **processes** and **products** meet written specifications
  - **Fitness for use** means that a product can be used as it was **intended**
- According to the PMP, quality management in project management is defined as “the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils the requirements.”

### Quality Metrics

- A **metric** is a standard of **measurement**
- To achieve the desired quality, we plan **quality activities**, like **reviews**, **inspections** and **testing**.
  - Outputs of these are called metrics, or measurements.
  - These metrics are compared against what is an acceptable range in a project.
- Metrics allow organisations to **measure** their **performance** in **certain areas** and to **compare** them **over time** or with other organizations
- Examples of common metrics used by organizations include **failure rates** of products produced, **availability** of goods and services, and **customer satisfaction** ratings

### Benefits of Project Quality Management

- **Higher Levels of Customer Satisfaction** - communicating with the customer will ensure they’re up to date and aware of any issues. Incremental customer feedback can also help you to deliver a better final product.
- **Better Quality Products** - This will help to deliver a final product that meets customer expectations.
- **Increased Productivity** - With a project quality management system everyone knows deadlines and what is needed in advance. Having set deadlines, meetings, and reports can influence the project team to hit targets early to keep the project on track.
- **Financial gains** - Projects can run over budget if good quality management is absent.

### Quality Planning

- **Quality planning** includes: 
  - identifying which **quality standards** are relevant to the project 
  - how best to **satisfy** those standards
- **Quality planning** also involves **designing quality** into:
  - the **products** of the project 
  - the **processes** involved in managing the project

- Like other plans, the **size** and **complexity** of **quality management plans** varies to meet project needs

## Processes in Quality Management

### Quality Planning

Here, the quality plan is created.
- Every plan should have a **desired objective** or **goal**, and quality plan is no exception.
- The goal of quality management should be **clearly communicated** to all the stakeholders in a project.
- After the goal is defined, the **measures** to ensure the level of standard should be identified.
  - How are you going **to measure** the customer **satisfaction**?
  - What is the **level of quality** that the **stakeholders are expecting**?
  - How to **determine** if the **quality measures** will lead to **project success**? 

### Quality Assurance

This procedure will supply **evidence** to your **stakeholders** that all activities relating to quality are being done as has been **defined** and **promised**.
- Quality assurance is all about **evaluating** if a project is moving towards delivering quality services.
- This can be achieved via a **project audit** or **process checklist**, and **tests**.
- Both **quantitative** and **qualitative** metrics are used so that you can measure project quality and consumer satisfaction effectively.

### Quality Control

Here, operational techniques are used to ensure quality standards.

- Any time a problem arises relating to quality or if the quality plan is not executed in the desired manner, **corrective actions** should be **effective**.
- Quality control involves **monitoring project results and delivery** to check if they are meeting desired results or not.
- If not, then **alternative actions** should be implemented.
- While **quality assurance** happens prior to a **problem benignly identified**, **quality control** is more of a **reaction process**, and so it happens once there has been the identification of a problem, with methods of improvement suggested here.

## Quality scope

Quality management includes both looking out for: 
- **product quality** (the system being created or maintained) 
- **process quality** (are you following good practices?)

Many organizations use **charts** to keep track of **metrics**, such as a **project dashboard**: a graphical screen summarizing **key project metrics**

## Quality costs

- Good quality often pays for itself in the long run
- Quality has more to do with **prevention** than **inspection**.
- When a product is made with better quality, then little effort and money needs to be spent in inspecting it.
- Work that carried out without many regards to quality, and there is a heavy dependency on inspection and the need to spend too much on rework.
  - Avoids defects, rework, bad publicity, etc.
  - It is also best to have in-process inspection at various points within the process while the product is being produced instead of final inspection.
  - If a defect is caught **early**, it takes **less** time and money to fix it. 

### Cost of Quality

- Quality costs include cost of **conformance** and costs of **non-conformance**.
  - **Cost of conformance** are all those costs that are expended in trying to achieve good quality.
  - **Cost of non-conformance** are all those costs that are expended because the quality is not good

| Cost of conformance | Cost of non-conformance                               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Process improvement | Rework                                                |
| Quality training    | Scrap                                                 |
| Inspection          | Loss of business due to adverse impact on brand image |
| Testing             | Warranty / Liability costs                            |
|                     | Litigation costs                                      |

`Cost of Quality` = `Cost of conformance` + `Cost of non-conformance`

### Optimum Point

If we invest, for example, £1 in the **cost of conformance**, and we tend to save more than £1 from the **cost of non-conformance**, then we reduce the CoQ.
- This continues until we reach the optimum level of quality.
- After this, additional £1 in cost of conformance gives less than £1 savings in cost of non-conformance.
- We always plan to achieve this optimum level of quality.

## Some definitions of Software Engineering

> The establishment and use of **sound engineering principles** (methods) in order to obtain economically **viable** software that is **reliable** and works on real machines. 
> 
> (Bauer, F. L. Software Engineering. Information Processing 71., 1972)
{: .prompt-tip }

> The application of a **systematic**, **disciplined**, **quantifiable** approach to the **development**, **operation**, and **maintenance** of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.
> 
> (IEEE Std 610-1990).
{: .prompt-tip }

> Software engineering is the technological and managerial discipline concerned with systematic production and maintenance of software products that are developed and modified on time and within cost estimates.
> 
> (Fairley, R. Software Engineering Concepts. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985)

> SEI software engineering definition from 1990 SEI Report on Undergraduate Software Engineering Education (CMU/SEI-90-TR-003 ): 
> 
> - Engineering is the **systematic** application of **scientific** knowledge in **creating** and **building cost-effective** solutions to practical problems in the service of mankind.
> - Software engineering is that form of engineering that applies the **principles of computer science** and **mathematics** to achieving **cost-effective** solutions to software problems.

>Software engineering is the discipline concerned with **developing large applications**. Software engineering covers not only the **technical aspects** of building software systems, but also **management issues**, such as **directing** programming **teams**, **scheduling**, and **budgeting**.

## What is Software Engineering?

- Engineering deals with the **understanding**, **design** and **implementation** of **large**, **complex** systems.
- Software engineering is concerned with **theories**, **methods** and **tools** for professional software development.
- It's not an exact science, rather a collection of **ideas**, **techniques** and **tools** which assist in the software development process.

Software engineer is the disciplined process of producing software:
  - It helps communicates the design to members of the team
  - It helps manage the process through the life cycle: from concept to delivery and through to decommissioning

## What is it different from other forms of engineering?

Many of the techniques of **general product management** are applicable to the software domain. However, there are **certain characteristics** that **distinguish** them from others. These are:

- **Invisibility**: when a physical artefact is being manufactured or constructed the progress can actually be seen. However, with software, progress is not always immediately visible. 
- **Complexity**: as a general statement, software products are more complex than other engineering artefacts.
- **Flexibility**: A major advantage of software is the ease with which it can be changed. Therefore, the general perception is that it is easier to accommodate changes in software than to change the physical or organisational systems in which the software interfaces with.
  - Hence, software systems are likely to be subject to a high degree of change.

## What is it about?

- **Group development**
  - formalise overall project to all team members.
- **Measure progress**
  - progress can be monitored and re-scheduled.
- **Identify subtasks**
  - easier to complete, test and integrate several small tasks rather than a single large one.
- **Cost-effective software development**
  - identify cost, time vs features, reliability, ease of use trade-offs.

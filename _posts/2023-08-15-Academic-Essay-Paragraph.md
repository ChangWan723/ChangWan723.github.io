## Paragraph Structure

* Topic sentence
   * the main and most general sentence, usually the first one
* Supporting sentence
   * more detailed ideas which follow and explain the topic sentence
* Concluding sentence
   * repetition of the main idea or comments about the topic

## Paragraph Rules

* There is **one and only one** main idea in each paragraph
* All supporting sentences directly **explain** and prove the **main idea**
* **Coherence**: smooth and logical flow of ideas from one sentence to another, with no sudden jumps

>Coherence can be achieved by:
>* repetition of key nouns
>* consistent use of pronouns
>* use of transition signals
>* logical organisation of ideas
{: .prompt-tip }

* **Logical** organisation of ideas
   * Chronological order (step by step, event by event)
   * Logical division of ideas (topic in parts, each part discussed separately)
   * Comparison/contrast (two or more things contrasted/compared)

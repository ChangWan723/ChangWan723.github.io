Büchi automaton is a type of ω-automaton (omega automaton) that accepts infinite strings. Named after its creator, Julius Richard Büchi, **this automaton is fundamental to many areas in formal verification**, especially in the realm of model checking for linear temporal logic properties.

## Introduction of Büchi Automaton

### What is Büchi Automaton?

A Büchi automaton is essentially a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) extended to infinite input sequences. Just like an NFA, a Büchi automaton **has a finite set of states and transitions**. However, the acceptance condition is different, **given that the input strings are infinite**.

### Formal Definition

A Büchi automaton is defined as a tuple \( A = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) \), where:

- `Q` is a finite set of states.
- `Σ` is a finite input alphabet.
- `δ` is a transition relation.
- `q0` is the initial state.
- `F` is a set of accepting states.

The acceptance condition for a Büchi automaton is slightly different from the usual finite automata. An infinite word is accepted if there exists a run (a sequence of state transitions) such that the automaton visits one of its accepting states infinitely often.

### Applications

Büchi automata are widely used in the formal verification of systems, especially in model checking of linear temporal logic (LTL) properties. LTL is a type of temporal logic that allows statements about sequences of states that a system can take. By converting LTL formulas to Büchi automata, verification tools can then check if a given system (modeled as another type of automaton) satisfies the desired properties.


## Finite Automaton

- finite automata accept/reject strings over a given alphabet
- equivalent to regular expressions

### Example of Finite Automaton

- the initial state is `s1`
- the final state is `s1`
- the string `abba` is accepted
- the string `bab` is rejected

### Consists of Finite Automaton

Let Σ be a finite alphabet (consisting symbols that we will use in strings/words over Σ).

- A finite automaton `A` accepts a finite word a1 ... an if there exists a run of A on a1,..., an which ends in an accepting state.

- The language of a finite automaton `A`, denoted L(A), consists of all the words it accepts.

## Büchi Automaton

### the Difference Between Finite Automaton and Büchi automaton

1. **Input Length**:
   - **Finite Automaton (FA)**: It operates on **finite-length input strings**. This means that the input strings will eventually terminate after a certain number of symbols.
   - **Büchi Automaton**: It is designed to operate on **infinite-length input strings**. These strings never terminate and continue indefinitely.

2. **Acceptance Condition**:
   - **Finite Automaton (FA)**: Acceptance is determined by whether the automaton **ends up in a designated "accept" or "final"** state after processing the entire input string.
   - **Büchi Automaton**: Given the infinite nature of the input, acceptance is defined in terms of recurring behaviors. Specifically, an **input is accepted if there exists a run (sequence of transitions)** such that the automaton visits one of its "accept" or "final" states infinitely often.

3. **Usage and Application**:
   - **Finite Automaton (FA)**: They are fundamental to many areas in computer science, including **lexical analysis** (part of the compilation process), **pattern matching**, and various **string-processing algorithms**.
   - **Büchi Automaton**: It's specifically used **in the realm of model checking**, especially for checking properties described by **linear temporal logic (LTL)** over infinite traces or behaviors.

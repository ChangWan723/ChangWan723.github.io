## Communications Planning

###  What Will Be Communicated?
- It is important that the performance report formats and frequencies are agreed upon with the stakeholders.
- Generally, the project team suggests the details that should go in the reports and get approval from the stakeholders.
- Different stakeholders have different communication requirements.
- Some would like to get detailed reports, whereas others would like to get summary reports
- Similarly, they might also need reports at different frequencies.

### When Will the Communication Happen?
- Every project sends reports at a set frequency - daily, twice a week, weekly, fortnightly, monthly etc.
- Many stakeholders would like to get a frequent report (weekly) and another less frequent report (monthly).
- All this needs to be captured and documented

### How will it be communicated
- There are various communication mediums using which reports can be sent.
- Most common mediums are letter and email.
- Stakeholders would have their own choice of medium using which they should receive the reports.

## Effective Communication

- Communication happens between two parties, sender and receiver.
- In order for the communication to be effective, there are certain pre-requisites.
- Effective communication means that the message sent by the sender has been understood by the receiver
- For verbal communication, it is the language, pronunciation, and the speed of the speech.
- For written communication, it is the language, spelling, and the handwriting.
- It is also important for the sender to use the correct communication medium.
  - **For all contractual communication, the communication has to be written.**

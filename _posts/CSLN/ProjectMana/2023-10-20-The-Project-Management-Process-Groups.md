**Project Management Process Groups** are a set of five interrelated and distinct phases **(Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing)** that cover the entire **project management life cycle**. They provide a framework for organizing and **managing projects effectively**.

## What Is a Systems Approach?

- A systems approach emerged in the 1950s to describe a holistic and analytical approach to management and problem-solving

- Three parts include:
  - **Systems philosophy**: an overall model for thinking about things as systems
  - **Systems analysis**: problem-solving approach
  - **Systems management**: address **business**, **technological**, and **organisational** issues before making changes to systems

## Project Life Cycle Models

- **Predictive life cycle**: The **scope**, **schedule**, and **cost** are **determined early**, and **changes** to scope are **carefully managed**.
  - Project Management Institute (PMI) also refers to predictive life cycles as **waterfall**.
- **Iterative life cycle**: The **scope** is **determined early**, but **time** and **cost** estimates are **modified** as the understanding of the product increases.
  - **Iterations** are used to develop the product through a **series of repeated cycles** to add to the functionality of the product.
  - This approach works best when there is a **high degree of change** and a **low frequency of delivery**.
- **Incremental life cycle**: **Deliverables** are produced through a **series of iterations** that add functionality within a **set time frame**.
  - The deliverable is not complete until after the **final iteration**.
  - This approach works best when there is a **low degree of change** and a **high frequency of delivery**.
- **Adaptive life cycle**: Stakeholders define and approve the **detailed scope** before the start of an **iteration**, producing a **usable product** at the end of **each iteration**. 
  - PMI also refers to adaptive life cycles as **agile** or change-driven.  
  - This approach works best when there is a **high degree of change** and a **high frequency of delivery**.
- **Hybrid life cycle**: A **combination** of approaches is used based on the nature of the work.
  - For example, some deliverables might have a low degree of change and low frequency of delivery such as monthly or quarterly progress reports.
  - On the other had a high degree of change and a high frequency of delivery such as certain software features, and so on.

### Predictive Life Cycle Models

- **Waterfall model**: has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support
- **Spiral model**: shows that software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach
- **Prototyping model**: used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements (heavy user involvement)
- **Rapid Application Development (RAD) model**: uses an approach in which developers work with an **evolving prototype**.
  - This life cycle model also requires **heavy user involvement** and helps produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality. 

## Knowledge Areas and Process Groups in Project Management

- Project management consists of **10 knowledge areas**:
  - Integration, scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management

- Projects involve five project management **process groups**:
  - Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, and closing

Alpha (Excellent) PM **spends more time on planning** and pay off in execution:

| Process Group               | Alpha PM | Average PM | Alpha Difference (%) |
|-----------------------------|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Initiating                  | 2%       | 1%         | 100% more            |
| Planning                    | 21%      | 11%        | 91% more             |
| Executing                   | 69%      | 82%        | 16% less             |
| Monitoring & Controlling    | 5%       | 4%         | 25% more             |
| Closing                     | 3%       | 2%         | 50% more             |
| Total                       | 100%     | 100%       |                      |


## Characteristics of the Process Groups

- The **amount** of resources and length of each process group varies for every project
  - Normally, **executing** tasks requires the **most resources** and **time**, followed by **planning** tasks
  - **Monitoring** and **controlling** processes are done **throughout** the projectâ€™s life span
  - **Initiating** and **closing** tasks are usually the **shortest** (at the beginning and end of a project or phase, respectively), and they require the **least amount** of resources and time
  - However, every project is unique, so there can be exceptions

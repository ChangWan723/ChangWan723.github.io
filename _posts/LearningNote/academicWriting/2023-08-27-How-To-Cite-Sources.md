## Quotation

### What is a Quotation?

**Quotations** must be **identical to the original**, using a narrow segment of the source. They must match the source document word for word and must be attributed to the original author.

* In academic writing, a quotation is the use of another writer’s exact words.
* You should only use quotations **occasionally**. When you use ideas from sources **you should paraphrase most of the time**.
* Do not use a quotation to make a point; only use a quotation to support your point.

### Why Use Quotations?

* You can use quotations to give a **definition**.
* You can use quotations to introduce a **specific phrase** that another writer has coined.
* You can use quotations when the original uses particularly **powerful language** that says what you want to say in a perfect way. Keep the quotation as short as possible.


### How to Reference Quotations?

All quotations must be **referenced in the text** and in the **reference list** :
* In the text, give the author’s surname, the year of publication, and the page number. For Example:

>The interactivity made possible by new media technologies means that professional journalists no longer determine what the public ‘‘see, hear and read about the world around us’’ (Deuze 2004, p. 146).


* In the reference list, give full details of the source.


## Paraphrase

### What is a Paraphrasing?

**Paraphrasing** involves putting a **passage from source material into your own words**. A paraphrase must also be attributed to the original source. Paraphrased material is usually shorter than the original passage, taking a somewhat broader segment of the source and condensing it slightly.

* If you paraphrase something from an outside source and include it in your own work it should always have an in-text reference.
* When paraphrasing you should aim to keep the same idea as the original but express it in a different way.
* It’s ok to include some key expressions directly taken from the original in quotation marks within a paraphrase.

### Why Use Paraphrasing Most of the Time?

Paraphrasing is what you should do most commonly in academic writing. Paraphrasing is preferred over quoting because **it shows that you understand the outside material you are using** and it gives you more agency over your paper by allowing you to explain the expert opinions, research studies, or other evidence to your reader as it relates to your topic and thesis. Paraphrasing will also provide a lower Turnitin score than quoting since **it incorporates your own academic voice**

### How to Reference Paraphrasing?

#### Paraphrasing Technique
1. Divide up the sentence in its original form into chunks of meaning, and start your paraphrase with a different part of the sentence
2. Consider changing nouns ← → verbs 
3. Consider changing active ← → passive
4. Consider adding a linking word/phrase
5. Finally, when you have chosen a structure, change the vocabulary
6. Remember to add a reference!

#### Example of Paraphrasing

original words:
> A wide range of concerns led to resistance to, or refusal of, services, even for some objectively 'stressed' carers.

---

paraphrasing:

Being reluctant to accept, or rejecting services, even for carers with evidence of clear ‘stress’, was caused by a wide variety of factors.

---

the final paraphrase in the essay:

Stirling’s (2010) study showed that being reluctant to accept, or rejecting services, even for carers with evidence of clear ‘stress’, was caused by a wide variety of factors.

## Summary

### What is a Summarizing?

**Summarizing** involves **putting the main idea(s) into your own words**, including only the main point(s). Once again, it is necessary to attribute summarized ideas to the original source. Summaries are significantly shorter than the original and **take a broad overview** of the source material.

### When to Use Summarizing?

Summarizing is reserved for **when you need to provide your reader with broad background information or a general overview of a topic**, theory, practice, or a literary work or film. A short summary might be included in an introductory paragraph or in the first body paragraph, which may focus on providing a general overview of the topic. Most body paragraphs will include paraphrases and/or quotes rather than a summary.

### The Difference Between Paraphrasing and Summarizing

**Paraphrasing** should contain EXACTLY the same ideas as the original, and not just focus on the main points.

**Summarizing** picks out only the main points of a much longer original text.

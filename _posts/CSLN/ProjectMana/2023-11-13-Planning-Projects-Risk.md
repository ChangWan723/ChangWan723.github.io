## Project Risk Management

- PMI defines a project **risk** as an **uncertainty** that can have a **negative** or **positive** effect on meeting project objectives
  - Risks may be **negative** ones that cause harm to the project (called **threats**) or **positive** ones that cause benefit to the project (called **opportunities**).
- We are most often worried about the threats as they have the ability to derail the project.
- **Inadequate risk planning** is the top cause of project **failures**.
- The main planning processes in risk management planning are:
  - **identifying risks**
  - **analysing risks**
  - **responding to risk**. 

### Identifying Risks

- The first and the most important step in risk management planning is to identify all the project risks.
  - You cannot manage risks until you **identify** them
- Identifying risks involves **determining** which risks are likely to affect a project and **documenting** the characteristics of each
  - The main outputs of this process are a **risk register** and a **risk report**
  - The most common ways of identifying risks on a project are **brainstorming**, **historical** information, and **checklists**.

#### What Is a Risk Register?

- A risk register is a document used as a **risk management tool** to **identify** potential **setbacks** within a project.
- The aims of risk register are to collectively **identify**, **analyse**, and **solve** risks before they become problems.
- While usually cantered around projects, other circumstances where risk management is helpful include product launches and manufacturing.

### Analysing Risk

_Analysis of Risks_

- **Severity** is just the **combination** of **probability** and **impact**
- Based on the combination, the priority is decided.

### Responding to Risks

Once the risks have been **prioritised**, we need to do something about them, so they do not interfere with the project objectives. We **start with the top** priority risk and go down.
- The responses to risk could be: **Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer**, or **Accept**.
  - **Avoiding** a risk means taking actions to completely remove the risk.
  - The most common response to risks is **mitigation**.
    - Mitigation means a reduction in the probability or impact of risk, or both.
  - **Transfer** of risk takes place when our actions transfer the risk to a third party.
    - The most common ways of transferring are **outsourcing and insurance**.
  - Finally, if nothing can be done about a risk or a risk is too low in priority, we may decide to **accept** the consequences of the Risk.
